## The Reactive Principles

- Reactive architecture is founded on what we call the Reactive Principles.
- The Reactive Manifesto is a document that was authored by Jonas Boner, Dave Farley, Roland Kuhn and Martin Thompson.
- The manifesto was created in response to companies trying to cope with changes in the software landscape.
- **Responsive**: Consistently respond in a timely fashion
- **Resilient**: Remain Responsive even when failure occurs. This is achieved through a number of techniques including 

     - *Replication* basically means we have multiple copies.
     - *Isolation* means that services can function on their own, they don't have external dependencies. 
     - *Containment* is a consequence of isolation. It means that if there is a failure it doesn't propagate to another service because it is isolated. 
     - *Delegation* means that recovery is managed by an external component. 

- **Elastic**: Remain Responsive despite increases or decreases to system load. It implies zero contention and no central bottlenecks. 
    
    - Scale up to handle peak load
    - Scale down in order to improve cost-effectiveness. 
- **Message Driven**: A reactive system is built on a foundation of Async, non-blocking messages

  - It provides loose coupling, isolation and location transparency 
  - It allows resources to be consumed only while active
