## Reactive Programming

### Reactive Systems vs. Reactive Programming

- Reactive Systems or Reactive Architecture and Reactive Programming are different.
- They are not equivalent
- Reactive systems apply the reactive principles at the architectural level
- Reactive Programming can be used to build Reactive Systems, and quite frequently is used to build Reactive Systems, but just because you use Reactive Programming doesn't mean you have created a Reactive System. 

### Reactive Systems

- The Reactive Manifesto principles are intrinsic to the design and architecture of Reactive Systems.
- All major architectural components will interact in a Reactive way. (architectural components are microservices and will be interacting with each other in a Reactive way)
- Reactive Systems are separated along asynchronous boundaries. 

### Reactive Programming

- Reactive Programming can be used to support the construction of Reactive Systems. 
- Supports breaking problems into small, discrete steps.
- Those individual steps are then executed in an asynchronous non-blocking fashion, usually through some sort of callback mechanism.
